## future steps from 09.10.2020 week
* [ ] Include a test-system, to figure out whether or not a file was fully translated and give a warning if it was not.
	* Any not-translated line is recognized by the value 'Enter your translation here'.
	* Additionally it might be necessary to test for empty strings in case a translator deleted the line.
	* The process should happen detached from the usual circle to not disrupt it.
* [ ] Generate an access-key for the translation api.
* [ ] Include the language negotiation in the code.

## Finished Steps from previous week
* [x] Include the written scripts into the circleci.
	* Adjust config.yml
	* Write a .sh script
		Issues/Questions/Comments:
		* Are the files saved correctly?
* [x] Update the html-generator.js to make it language aware
	* Additionally the templates need to be adjusted (ap2.js, voc2.j2)
		Issues/Questions/Comments:
		* The issue remaining is, that the rendered html file requires two different formats of json structures to display
		  the properties in the voc layout. I am guessing, that there is an issue with the voc2.s2 but I could not quite 
		  point out the fault
		* The created classes are the html-generator2 and linkeddataparser3
		* I did not adjust the template (only for testing reasons) because I think it makes most sense to create a new template
		  for each language due to many hardcoded danish words/paragraphs.
* [x] Generate a new Git-Project/Repository to save the outcomes. 
	* Can be created with the repository-template
		Issues/Questions/Comments:
		* I'd need some input again what exactly I need to adjust in the config

## Steps for this week
* [ ] Include language awareness into the config files used in circle ci
	* Update at least for Translation Json
	* And Template
* [ ] Include a few more examples
* [ ] Repair html voc-template issue
