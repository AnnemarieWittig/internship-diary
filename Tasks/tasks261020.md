## future steps from 09.10.2020 week
* [ ] Include a test-system, to figure out whether or not a file was fully translated and give a warning if it was not.
	* Any not-translated line is recognized by the value 'Enter your translation here'.
	* Additionally it might be necessary to test for empty strings in case a translator deleted the line.
	* The process should happen detached from the usual circle to not disrupt it.
* [ ] Generate an access-key for the translation api.
* [ ] Include the language negotiation in the code.
