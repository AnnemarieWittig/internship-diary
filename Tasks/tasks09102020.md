## What has been done
*  [x] Script to extract the translateable information from a jsonld file was written (translation-json-generator.js).
	* The script extracts the attributes and values of the name, label, description and definition of the classes and properties. Additionally it reads out the usage in the properties. There needs to be a language tag of the main language, that shall be translated, and the goal-language, that it shall be translated to. Then the goal-language-tag will be added to all the named attributes with the value 'Enter your translation here'.
*  [x] Write a script to update translation-json filed in case new attributes are added or existing one delted (translation-json-update.js).
	* The script compares an existing translation-json to another jsonld file. Here, too, you need to give a main- and a goallanguage. It iterates through all the classes/properties of the translation-json and gets the fitting classes/properties from the jsonld based on their '@id'. It will compare, if all attributes with language tags exist in the translation-json and adds them if they do not. Any attributes without language tags will be ignored and any attributes that exist in the translation-json and not in the jsonld will be deleted. Additionally attributes in the jsonld that include the names of the translation-json attributes will be ignored (this should prevent the adding of values like 'api-label-nl').
*  [x] Read into machine-translation-apis.
	* The api that stood out as most suitable is the microsoft translation api which is part of microsoft azure.
	* The pricing can be found [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/cognitive-services/translator/).
	* The documentation can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/de-de/azure/cognitive-services/translator/quickstart-translator?tabs=nodejs).
*  [x] Think about possibilities to include the language negotiation into the content negotiation.
	* Has yet to be discussed.

## Next steps
* [ ] Include a test-system, to figure out whether or not a file was fully translated and give a warning if it was not.
	* Any not-translated line is recognized by the value 'Enter your translation here'.
	* Additionally it might be necessary to test for empty strings in case a translator deleted the line.
	* The process should happen detached from the usual circle to not disrupt it.
* [ ] Generate an access-key for the translation api.
* [ ] Include the language negotiation in the code.
